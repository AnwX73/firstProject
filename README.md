# firstProject

## Project Description  
This is my first complete website project, created during high school in 2023.  
The idea was to help other high school students like me understand school systems and updates at that time.  

I built it using basic knowledge of **HTML** and **CSS**.  
One limitation of the project is that it only supports desktop screens — it doesn’t display properly on mobile devices.

## How to Run  
1. Download or clone the repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser on a desktop screen.
